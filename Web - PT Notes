To Find out frameword being used by the favicon, check the md5 checksum against OWASP favicon database:
https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_favicon_database

### Run

```curl
curl https://website.com/favicon/images/favicon.ico | md5sum
```

Note: Make sure to change website.com/ to the path of the favicon and check md5 against the OWASP database, if the hash ends with 427e, then your hash failed and you should try again.

You can also run this for powershell:

```Powershell
curl https:/website.com/favicon/images/favicon.ico -UseBasicParsing -o favicon.ico
Get-FileHash .\favicon.ico -Algorithm MD5
```
